# artpostings
Website to display paintings. This was an MVC5 project using SQL Server, MVC identity, web drag and drop, extensive use of AJAX callbacks. An implementation can be viewed on http://annchambers.net. It was developed over quite a long period of time on an 'evenings and weekends' basis. It still contains quite a lot of hard-coded logic which I haven't yet got round to implementing in a more acceptable manner!
