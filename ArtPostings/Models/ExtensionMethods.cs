    /// Provides string extension methods to help deal with formatting issues
    /// There are three formats, apart from vanilla text, in use in the application:
    /// 1. Html strings where it is necessary to replace soft spaces with &nbsp (non-breaking spaces). This is used for the title field
    ///    in the ItemPosting class. Failure to use it caused the painting title to be broken at the first space
    /// 
    /// 2. Url-encoded strings where the space character is replaced with %20. The HttpUtility.UrlPathEcode is used in this application
    ///    in the ItemPosting class.   
    /// 
    ///    The official advice is not to use UrlPathEncode because it does not escape all alphanumerics. Trouble
    ///    is - the src attribute of the img tag requires a vanilla string with single quotes and space chararcters where
    ///    they appear in the filename. Even if you use UrlDecode in the view, UrlEncode replaces space chararcters with 
    ///    '+' symbols, which seem to be converted back to breaking space characters by UrlDecode
    /// 
    /// 3. JavaScript-friendly strings where the single quote is replaced with \'. This is used in the PictureFileRecord class and the     /// 
    ///    value is made available to the startdrag and filedelete functions in Admin/_PictureList.cshtml    ///
