Next steps:

- Factor out repository calls to a service. Currently all shopwindow controllers call the same repo method - bad!
- probably need to combine _archive.cshtml and _shopwindow.cshtml into 1 with text passed in from the controller
- dependency injection
- data access
- push --mirror to github: see - https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line/
